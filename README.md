## User manual
### Player 1 (Dheeg)
Dheeg has to collect the correct materials, deposit them in the cooking pot, assemble them together by pressing the directions on the D-Pad at the forge and drop them off at the deposit box. Doing so awards Player 2 with ammunition that they can use to defend the kitchen from all 8 of Dheeg's evil twins. For some reason they are all named Mheet, which is probably why they became evil.

### Player 2 (Mark S. Mann)
Mark is controller by using the NES Zapper. You can shoot enemies by pointing at them and pulling the trigger. Doing so consumes ammo, which can only be replenished by Player 1. Mark is Dheeg's childhood friend and long-lost 9th twin.
